# Operating the Foundry

## Creating a lab environment

You can create a lab environment for multiple students in AWS by first cloning this repository

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/EngineerBetter/summit-training-classes.git
cd summit-training-classes/operator
./scripts/create-vpc.sh $NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS
```

This creates the file `terraform/students.json` which contains an array of objects containing settings for an independant BOSH lite deployments.

If you would like do deploy those bosh environemnts, you can use the following command:

```
jq -c '.[]' terraform/students.json | while read -r info
do
    ./scripts/deploy-bosh.sh "$(jq -r '.access_key_id' <<< "$info")_" <<< $info
done
```
