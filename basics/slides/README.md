# Instructor Notes

This document provides notes for would-be instructors of the Zero To Hero course. Please endeavour to keep this up-to-date when making changes to the slides themselves.

## 1. What is Cloud Foundry?

Students must understand the importance of Cloud Foundry in the wider context of the industry and of digital transformation.

Establish early that this course focuses on the _Application Runtime_ and not the _Container Runtime_.

### Key Takeaways

* Cloud Foundry enables you to **deliver software more quickly**, which in turn allows an organisation to become a continuously-delivering _learning_ organisation. The **step-change in pace is transformative**.
* Cloud Foundry allows freedom and flexibility. It is **portable across IaaSes**, allows the use of **any language** (which may be novel in large enterprises), and the consumption of any data service.
* Cloud Foundry is **primarily suited towards 12 Factor apps**, but can also run monoliths (via Docker-based apps, volume services). It doesn't mean you _should_, though.
* The CFF owns the IP, meaning **the project can't be subverted by one vendor**.

### Notes

This section often takes the longest, as there's a lot of background that can be explained.

You may need to explain what the 12 Factor manifesto is.

For a non-operator audience, the "where to get OS CF" slide is of minimal important. If you've got operators, they'll be keen to expand on this a little.
